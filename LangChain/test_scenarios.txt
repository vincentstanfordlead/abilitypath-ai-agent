## Testing Tips:

1. **Start simple:** Test basic conversations first
2. **Try variations:** Change the wording, see if it still works
3. **Test edge cases:** What if user is vague? What if they say "I don't know"?
4. **Check empathy:** Does the AI sound caring and supportive?
5. **Verify matching:** Are the program recommendations accurate?

## What to Look For:

✅ Agent asks follow-up questions naturally
✅ Agent extracts age correctly
✅ Agent identifies needs from conversation
✅ Recommendations are relevant and accurate
✅ Tone is warm and empathetic (not robotic)
✅ Agent provides actionable next steps

## Common Issues to Watch:

❌ Agent doesn't extract age from text like "22 years old"
❌ Agent asks too many questions before recommending
❌ Agent misses obvious needs from the conversation
❌ Recommendations don't match the described situation
❌ Tone is too formal or cold
