## PART 1: CRITICAL PROGRAM DATA (20 minutes)

### **Context:** We've built a working prototype with 10 sample programs. We need YOUR actual programs and eligibility criteria to make it real.

### **1.1 Program Inventory** ⭐ MOST CRITICAL

**Q1:** "We understand you have 15+ programs. Can you walk us through your TOP 5-7 most frequently requested programs?"

**For each program, we need:**
- Official program name
- 1-sentence description (for families)
- Age range (min-max)
- Key eligibility requirements (what MUST they have/need?)
- What disqualifies someone?
- Typical next steps after match

**Follow-up:** "Can you share a program catalog, brochure, or website link we can reference?"

---

### **1.2 Real-World Scenarios** ⭐ CRITICAL

**Q2:** "Can you describe 3 actual families who came to you recently?"
- What was their situation?
- What did they ask for?
- What program(s) did you recommend?
- Why was it a good match?

**Purpose:** This gives us real test cases and helps us understand your matching logic.

---

### **1.3 SARC Integration** 

**Q3:** "How does the SARC (San Andreas Regional Center) process work in practice?"
- What are the 3-5 most common documents families need?
- What's the typical timeline from first contact to enrollment?
- At what point in the process should our chatbot hand off to human staff?

**Q4:** "Are there SARC eligibility requirements we should check BEFORE recommending programs?"
- Age limits?
- Disability types?
- Residency requirements?

---

### **1.4 Existing Systems & Data**

**Q5:** "Do you have any existing intake forms, questionnaires, or screening tools we can see?"

**Q6:** "Where does intake information currently go?" 
- CRM system?
- Spreadsheet?
- Database?
- Email?

**Purpose:** Understanding integration needs for post-hackathon.

---

## PART 2: CONVERSATION FLOW VALIDATION (15 minutes)

### **Context:** We've designed a conversational flow. Let's validate it works for your families.

### **2.1 Live Demonstration**

**DEMO:** [Show the current prototype working]
- Walk through Maria & Kevin scenario
- Show how it extracts age and needs
- Show program recommendations

**Q7:** "Does this conversational approach feel right for your families?"
- Too formal/informal?
- Too many/few questions?
- Missing critical questions?

---

### **2.2 Key Information to Collect**

**Q8:** "What are the MINIMUM pieces of information you need to recommend a program?"

**Rank these by importance:**
- Age
- Specific needs/behaviors
- Current services/supports
- Location/county
- Transportation needs
- Parent/caregiver situation
- Medical diagnoses
- School status (if applicable)
- Employment goals
- Living situation

**Q9:** "What information do you NOT need at first contact?"
(We want to avoid overwhelming families)

---

### **2.3 Language & Tone**

**Q10:** "How do you typically describe your programs to families?"
- What language do you use?
- What do you avoid saying?
- What terms need explanation?

**Q11:** "Are there specific phrases or words that resonate with families?"
- Maria's story mentions "daytime support" - is that common language?
- What other terms do families use?

---

## PART 3: SUCCESS CRITERIA (15 minutes)

### **Context:** We need to define what "success" looks like for the prototype and beyond.

### **3.1 Prototype Success (Next 2 Days)**

**Q12:** "For our hackathon demo on [date], what would make you say 'This is worth continuing'?"

**Possible answers to probe:**
- Matches programs correctly for 3 test scenarios?
- Feels welcoming and empathetic?
- Captures key information accurately?
- Provides clear next steps?

---

### **3.2 Real-World Deployment**

**Q13:** "If this were live on your website next month, what would be the #1 thing it MUST do right?"

**Q14:** "What would be a dealbreaker? What would make you pull it offline?"

---

### **3.3 Measurement**

**Q15:** "How would you measure if this is working?"

**Prompt with examples:**
- % of conversations that result in program match?
- Reduction in intake phone calls?
- Time saved per family?
- Quality of referrals (fewer mismatches)?
- Family satisfaction scores?

---

## PART 4: DEMO & FEEDBACK (20 minutes)

### **Context:** Show them what we've built and iterate in real-time.

### **4.1 Live Demo**

**DEMO SCRIPT:**
1. Show web interface
2. Run through 2 scenarios (prepared + their real scenario)
3. Show terminal logs (how it extracts information)
4. Show program matching logic

**Q16:** "Let's try one of your real scenarios. Can you pretend to be [family from Q2]?"
- They type what the family would say
- We watch it work (or fail!)
- We discuss what needs to change

---

### **4.2 Rapid Iteration**

**Q17:** "If you could change ONE thing right now, what would it be?"

**Q18:** "What's confusing or unclear?"

**Q19:** "What's missing that you expected to see?"

---

## PART 5: NEXT STEPS (10 minutes)

### **5.1 Post-Hackathon Path**

**Q20:** "If we win/do well at the hackathon, what happens next?"
- Pilot with real families?
- Integration with your systems?
- Staff training?
- Funding/budget?

**Q21:** "What would you need from us to move forward?"
- Technical documentation?
- Training materials?
- Ongoing support?

---

### **5.2 Data Sharing**

## 🎬 **SAMPLE OPENING SCRIPT**

_"Thank you so much for meeting with us! We're really excited about helping AbilityPath serve families faster._

_We've actually built a working prototype already—it's a conversational AI agent that talks to families, understands their needs, and recommends programs. Let me show you real quick..._

_[2-minute demo of Maria & Kevin scenario]_

_So that's what we have. Now we need YOUR help to make it real. We need to replace our sample programs with your actual programs, and we want to make sure the conversation flow works for your families._

_Can we spend the next hour getting the details we need? Then we'll iterate on the demo together and make sure it feels right._

_Sound good?"_

## 💡 **PRO TIPS**

### **Tip 1: Show, Don't Tell**
Start with a 2-minute demo. It's 100x more effective than explaining.

### **Tip 2: Use Their Language**
When they describe scenarios, write down exact phrases they use. Use those in your prompts.

### **Tip 3: Get Specifics**
Don't accept "We serve adults with disabilities." Ask: "What ages? What types of support? What makes someone a good fit?"

### **Tip 4: Capture Stories**
Real family stories are gold. They become your test cases and demo scenarios.

### **Tip 5: Validate in Real-Time**
After they describe a program, show them how the chatbot would handle it. Iterate immediately.

### **Tip 6: Get Data to Go**
Don't rely on memory. Get documents, forms, links DURING the meeting.

### **Tip 7: Set Up Success**
End with: "We'll send you a video of the updated prototype in 24 hours. Does that work?"
